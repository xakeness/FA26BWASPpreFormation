Pre formation lights rivets/panels

    This is merely a repository for my old work on the F/A-26B rivets/panels layer, as I have since started working on new rivets/panels that incorporate the new formation lights that are included in the 1.10 version of the game.
    This is a pet project of mine personally, because i've just wanted more details on the 26B
Frequently Asked Questions
When can I get this for all other airframes?

    I am wanting to do one for the AV-42C and F-45A, and after i'm done with that I'll see if i can improve upon the AH-94/t-55's already present rivets/panels

Why are there six different versions to download?

    Each version is identical in terms of rivets/panels but I wanted to vary the dirt layer between them so I made six different versions of dirt because it affords more contrast if you have different variations.

Are you going to make more than six?

    I'm actually working on a couple different variations of the vert stabs based on the F-15 and the Su-27 so yes i'll do at least six of each for the different 26B variations
